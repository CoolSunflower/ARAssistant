Current Progress:
- You can place the agent on the floor
- You can tap top left button to start recording your voice and the agent will lip sync to your voice, top right button to stop
- Bottom button currently does not do anything

Next steps:
- Remove lip sync with human user audio as that was just for testing
- Add STT using bottom button & debug info.
- LLM backend
- Local TTS on Android -> AudioClip -> uLipSync
- Default animation of agent
- End to end testing
- Adding Sign Language and Gesture detection to backend
- Integrating Sign Language and Gesture support with agent
